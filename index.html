        <p>Mobile Application - Visual Note (Example Information)</p>

        <div class="infosize">
            <p>(Example Information) I designed and implemented an iOS mobile application called Visual Note. The idea
                behind the app is to allow the users to take notes with pictures. For example, if a user saw a poster,
                he/she could simply take a picture of the poster using the app, and save it as a visual note which they
                can name and categorize. Moreover, they can add a text side note to their visual note, and set a
                reminder as well. The application allows the users to quickly and easily find their saved visual notes
                through the name or the category. The whole application was built using objective-c and coredata.</p>

        <p>Web-based Game - Battleship(Example Information)</p>

        <div class="infosize">
            <p>(Example Information) I designed and built a web based multiplayer game called battleship. The game was
                built using PHP for the back-end. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery for the front-end. The communication
                between the front-end and the back-end was done through AJAX as a web-service calls. The database used
                was MySQL, and proper encryption along side best security practices were implemented throughout the
                project. The web-based game used cookies and sessions to handle users login, and it allowed users to
                chat in a game lobby and challenge each other to a game. It also kept track of each user wins/losses.
                Finally, all error handling was done as well including cases like loss of connection while players are
                playing the game (players can resume the game).</p>
